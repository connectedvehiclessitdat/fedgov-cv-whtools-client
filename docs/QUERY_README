This application reads files from the requests directory and sends them to the Warehouse to be executed.
Files that start with the "QUERY:" tag are treated as query requests - one time data request from the Warehouse's
databases. An example QUERY file is given below with a description for each field.

Field Descriptions:

systemQueryName		The name of the Warehouse system you would like to query.
dialogID			A SemiDialogID from the SEMI.asn file indicating the type of message requested.  The application
					currently supports dialogIDs 154 (vehSitDataMessage), 156 (travelerInfomation), and 162 (intersectionSitData)
startDate			A starting date field for date range queries.  Format is yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss
startDateOperator	The operator applied to startDate when startDate is included.  Valid values are "GT", "GTE", "LT", "LTE" 
					(greater than, greater than or equal, less than, less than or equal respectively)  
endDate				A ending date field for date range queries.  Format is yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss
endDateOperator		The operator applied to endDate when endDate is included.  Valid values are "GT", "GTE", "LT", "LTE" 
					(greater than, greater than or equal, less than, less than or equal respectively)
nwLat				The latitude value for the northwest corner of the bounding box for geo-spatial queries
nwLon				The longitude value for the northwest corner of the bounding box for geo-spatial queries
seLat				The latitude value for the southeast corner of the bounding box for geo-spatial queries
seLon				The longitude value for the southeast corner of the bounding box for geo-spatial queries
orderByField		The name of the field to order your results by.  To see all available field names run a query with the
					resultEncoding option set to "full"
orderByOrder		How to order the results either 1 (Ascending) or -1 (Descending)
skip				The number of records to initially skip in the result set.
limit				The number of records to limit the result set by.
resultEncoding		The encoding type for the resulting records.  Valid values are "hex", "base64", and "full".  "hex" returns the
					message as a hex encoded string.  "base64" encodes the hex message using base64 encoding.  "full" returns the
					entire record from the warehouse including all meta data and the base64 encoded message.
