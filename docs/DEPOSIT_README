Deposits work a little differently from Queries and Subscriptions in that you don't need to supply the actual JSON
deposit messages that are sent to the server.  The application will take care of this for you.  All deposits are controlled 
by the values set in the application configuration file whconfig.json (see CONFIG_README).

Files placed in the configurable "depositFileDir" are read by this application and sent to the system identified
by "systemDepositName" to be deposited into the Warehouse.  

The fields in whconfig.json that control Deposits are below.  Please see CONFIG_README for an explanation of these fields.

    "systemDepositName": "SDC 2.3",
    "encodeType": "hex",
    "depositFileDir": "deposits",
    "depositDelay": 200
