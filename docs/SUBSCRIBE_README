This application reads files from the requests directory and sends them to the Warehouse to be executed.
Files that start with the "SUBSCRIBE:" tag are treated as subscription requests - a long running request for the
streaming of live Warehouse data. An example SUBSCRIBE file is given below with a description for each field.

SUBSCRIBE:{
    "systemSubName": "SDC 2.3",
    "dialogID": 154,
    "vsmType": 1,
    "nwLat": 42.351440029174164,
    "nwLon": -83.13457489013672,
    "seLat": 42.31184652369511,
    "seLon": -82.97218322753906,
    "resultEncoding": "hex",
    "messageDelay": 1000
} 

Field Descriptions:

systemSubName		The name of the Warehouse system you would like to subscribe to.
dialogID			A SemiDialogID from the SEMI.asn file indicating the type of message requested.  The application
					currently supports dialogIDs 154 (vehSitDataMessage), 156 (travelerInfomation), 162 (intersectionSitData), or -1 for all types
vsmType				The VsmTyp if a dialogID of 154 (vehSitDataMessage) is selected.  This vsmType is the Integer value of the SEMI Octet string 
nwLat				The latitude value for the northwest corner of the bounding box for geo-spatial subscriptions
nwLon				The longitude value for the northwest corner of the bounding box for geo-spatial subscriptions
seLat				The latitude value for the southeast corner of the bounding box for geo-spatial subscriptions
seLon				The longitude value for the southeast corner of the bounding box for geo-spatial subscriptions
resultEncoding		The encoding type for the resulting records.  Valid values are "hex", "base64", and "full".  "hex" returns the
					message as a hex encoded string.  "base64" encodes the hex message using base64 encoding.  "full" returns a json
					record of parsed information used for plotting on GUI
messageDelay		The amount of time in milliseconds the server will use to space each message before streaming them
					to the client.  Can be used to help "smooth" out the message subscription stream.  The default is 0 
					meaning the server will send out messages as quickly as it receives them (messages may be received in 
					batches).  For any positive value up to 10000 the server will space messages out by that time.  For a 
					negative value the server will attempt to send messages out at the exact same interval that they were
					originally received by looking at the timestamp in each message.  Note that the server has an upper bounds
					as to how many messages that it will buffer up for each client connection.  A high messageDelay value and high
					data rate can lead to a case where the buffer limit is exceeded. At that point the server will temporarily 
					disable the messageDelay to flush the buffer.  After the buffer has been flushed the messageDelay will be
					reset to its original value.
