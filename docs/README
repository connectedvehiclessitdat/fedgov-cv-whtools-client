DESCRIPTION:
This is a Java-based Warehouse Client application for the Connected Vehicle Project.  This client is
used to retrieve messages from the Connected Vehicle Warehouse via a query or subscription mechanism,
and now deposit messages into the Warehouse via WebSockets.

SOURCE CODE:
File fedgov-cv-whtools-client-1.0.0-sources.jar contains bare bone source code for the client.
Also, for convenience, a complete Eclipse Maven project fedgov-cv-whtools-client-1.0.0-project.zip is included as well.

BUILDING:
We recommend using provided Eclipse Maven project for building. 
One jar file with all required dependencies is created along with a .zip
file containing the jar file, configuration files, and start scripts. 

USAGE:
To run the application, unzip fedgov-cv-whtools-client-1.0.0-bin.zip to your desired location, modify the whconfig.json
file for your setup, and run the start_wh_client.bat/sh script to start the application.

CONFIGURATION:
The config/whconfig.json contains the configuration information used by this application.  It is described in the
docs/CONFIG_README file.  Requests sent from this application are read by default from files in the requests directory
on file addition or modification.  Requests can be of type QUERY or SUBSCRIBE format.  Those formats are described in the 
docs/QUERY_README and docs/SUBSCRIBE_README files.  Files placed in the configurable deposit directory are deposited into
the Warehouse.  See docs/DEPOSIT_README for additional information.

RESPONSE MESSAGE PROCESSING:
The gov.usdot.cv.whtools.client.handler.ResponseHandler class processes messages received by this client
from the warehouse.  It has the ability to log received messages to console and write them to disk.  This 
class can be modified to additionally process each message as you see fit.
